# "Delta" Stirling engine

!["Delta" Stirling](share/Thumbnail.png)

An innovative Stirling engine of revised design with increased specific power.

## Relevance

Modern car and powerplant engines, solar panels have not so much efficiency. Therefore engines affect ecology quite seriously, solar panels produce less energy than they could. Cars' ICEs are restricted in energy sources by their design. Modern Stirling engines have high efficiency only at low powers relative to their masses, so they can't solve problems stated above.

## This model specification

  * Power: ~600 W.
  * Efficiency: ~50%.
  * Working fluid: air at atmospheric pressure.
  * Size: <30 cm.
  * Main material: stainless steel.

*Specifications are not accurate at the moment and may change significantly during the tests.*

## Design features

Slow heat exchange problem has been solved by invention of the thin heat exchanger (inner thickness is 0.5 mm) with sealed displacement piston. 20 heat exchangers are combined into a radiator to increase area, which means power.

*Two*, hot and cold, heat exchangers are funtional from *both* sides, i. e. these *two* sides are connected to *two* working cylinders and to each other by *two* regenerators. That ensures full load of heat exchangers.

The detailed engine description is in the "Delta" Stirling engine: overview" article available at [Дзен](https://dzen.ru/a/ZjI1lzHqzjpZLhe3?share_to=link) and in [this repository](Двигатель%20Стирлинга%20&laquo;Дельта&raquo;:%20обзорная%20статья.md) (only Russian language).

*By the way, I want to draw your attention to my article about previous Stirling engine model of similar design at [Дзен](https://dzen.ru/a/Ywe-duoiYVKAe5At?share_to=link).*

# Project progress

The necessary design documentation has been developed. Technological... isn't as necessary. All is ready for the direct parts production and then for the Stirling engine assembly.

You have an opportunity to study this model design from "src/model.FCStd" 3D-model made using [FreeCAD](https://freecad.org) 0.20.2.

Also there are the drawings in PDF and SVG formats, the "metal scheme.dxf" laser cutter scheme, the models for the CNC machines and 3D-printers in STEP format in the "bin" folder.

You are welcome with material and professional support of this project.

## Material support

The project is at the finish line! Now it requires just much money on materials and hardware, then the engine will be done.

## Professional support

I need qualified engineers support in design, bugs catching, calculations and so on.
